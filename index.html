      <p>
        I am currently working on front-end projects including a personal
        portfolio, and interning as a content writer in an organization. I like to keep pace with new
        technologies especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I'm flexible enough to fit into any
        work culture. Getting exposure to the professional world will only expand my horizon to newer
        directions.
